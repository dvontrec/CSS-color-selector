Web App for selecting CSS colors based on rgba values.  The Background changes dynamically as the sliders are moved.  Users can click the Change Color button to randomize the Red, Green, or Blue value.  The Copy Color button is can also be used to copy the color directly to the users clipboard.  

Many thanks to [Emma Wymann](https://github.com/ejwyman64) for help with the CSS and helping to make for a better user experience
